## Overview
This project combines gene expression data, spatial data, and machine learning outputs to identify and visualize significant biomarkers across regions. Key visualizations include enhanced volcano plots, SHAP beeswarm plots for feature importance, and GeoJSON-based maps for spatial biomarker analysis.

## Setup Instructions

To run the code and generate the visualizations, please follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   gh repo clone YP-118/Info_Interim
    ```
   
2. **Set up the Python environment**: Ensure you have Python 3.8 or above installed.
   
3. **Install additional libraries used in the visualizations**: This project requires the following Python libraries:

   - **Folium** (for interactive maps):
     ```bash
     pip install folium
     ```

   - **Matplotlib** (for static plots):
     ```bash
     pip install matplotlib
     ```

   - **Plotly** (for interactive plots):
     ```bash
     pip install plotly
     ```

4. **Run the notebooks**: Navigate to the `Code/` folder and open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or any compatible IDE (e.g., VSCode).

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to run the notebooks:

1. **Volcano Plot**:
   - Open the `Volcano_Plot.ipynb` notebook in the `Code/` directory.
   - Follow the instructions to load the data and generate the volcano plot.
   - The output will be saved to `Visualization/Volcano_Plot.png`.

2. **SHAP Analysis**:
   - Open the `TCGA_preprocessing_SHAP.ipynb` notebook in the `Code/` directory.
   - This notebook processes TCGA data and generates SHAP beeswarm plots for feature importance.
   - The visualizations will be saved as `Visualization/SHAP_XGBoost.png` and `Visualization/SHAP_log.png`.

3. **GeoJSON Map**:
   - Open the `Map.ipynb` notebook in the `Code/` directory.
   - Follow the steps to generate an interactive GeoJSON-based map visualizing biomarkers by region.
   - The output will be saved to `Visualization/Map.png`.
